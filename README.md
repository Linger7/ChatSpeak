# ChatSpeak

ChatSpeak will be a stand-alone web application designed to give users the ability to host their own chatroom server, in which the server operator and users can define their own chatrooms, from which they can communicate with other users.  These chatrooms can be defined as public, passworded, or private based on permissions.  Users can opt to register an account or remain anonymous, registering an account enables users to create chat channels or enter private channels, if given the permission.  All interactions, such as creating a channel, joining a private channel, being able to chat and more, will be controlled by a permission system, which can be managed by the server operator through a control panel.
